# Solar-Radiation-Predictive-Modelling

Predicting the level of solar radiation from the measurable meteorological information provided by NASA HI-SEAS (Hawaii’s Space Exploration Analog and Simulation mission) sensors.

This allows the HI-SEAS crew, or other explorers reliant on solar panels, to plan their daily energy consumption for all their human necessities and other planned activities based on expected energy output from solar panels.
